Recently, Fan Hui and Lee Sedol, both Go professionnals got defeated
by Google DeepMind's Go AI AlphaGo. On Tuesday (2016-03-29), I gave a
talk about it.

I go over the algorithm used by previous AIs, why it was used, and
go on to show how AlphaGo extended it.

Being a Go player myself, it was very exciting to witness such
historical matches. I was also glad to see a surge in new players in
my town and on reddit. I hope this AI achievment will help us
westerners grow the game.

Here is a video of the talk (in French):
