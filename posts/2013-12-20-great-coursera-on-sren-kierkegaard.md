title: Great coursera on Søren Kierkegaard

From Oct 7th to Dec 1st, [a course][coursera] on Søren Kierkegaard
focusing on subjectivity, irony and modernity was going on on
Coursera. It was extremely interesting and I strongly recommend that
you follow the next occurrence, whenever it's back on track.

The approach is quite interesting: to tackle despair, lack of meaning
in the modern world and deep questions around those themes, this
course turns to Socrates and Søren Kierkegaard.

It appears quite quickly that those questions were already central
back in ancient Greece or in the Denmark of the 19th century. The
answers given by those philosophers are quite easy to sum up: stop
looking for meaning in society, in the prominent culture or what
you're told. Doubt what you've not analysed. Build your meaning of
life, because you won't find it lying around and the one you might
have been given is worth nothing if you didn't turn it your own by a
personnal work.

This answer will resist the test of time. It just explicits the fact
that people have to be adults. You won't be given a free solution to
life but have to work out your own. This is actually an important step
in one's thought and life construction.

You might have already come up to those conclusions on your own. Even
if that is the case, this course is a nice conceptualisation of those
principles and still worth the watch. I hope you'll enjoy the next
session if you decide to follow it :)
