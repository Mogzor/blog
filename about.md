I am Hugo Mougard and currently a Master's degree student at the
[University of Nantes](http://atal.univ-nantes.fr/), in the natural
language processing field ([résumé](http://88.191.117.112/public/resume.pdf)).

Besides interesting problems and algorithms, I love free software as a
way to have a philosophically interesting impact on society whilst
still remaining in the computer science domain.

Apart from Computer Science, I enjoy [classical
piano](https://youtu.be/0FbQZCsYXVg), [old
movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060522/), philosophy, boxing and
strategy games---from [chess](http://www.chesscube.com/) to DotA.
