First and foremost, to discuss the content of this blog or about
anything you'd like, you can [email me](mailto:mog@crydee.eu) or talk
to me on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/)---I'm m0g back
there.

Otherwise, I am Hugo Mougard and currently a Master's degree student
at the [University of Nantes](http://atal.univ-nantes.fr/), in the
natural language processing field
([résumé](http://88.191.117.112/public/resume.pdf)).

Besides interesting problems and algorithms, I love free software as a
way to have a philosophically interesting impact on society whilst
still remaining in the computer science domain.

Apart from Computer Science, I enjoy [classical
piano](https://youtu.be/0FbQZCsYXVg), [old
movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060522/), philosophy, boxing and
strategy games---from [chess](http://www.chesscube.com/) to DotA.
