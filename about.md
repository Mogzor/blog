First and foremost, to discuss the content of this blog or about
anything you'd like, you can [email me][1] or talk to me on
[freenode][2]---I'm m0g back there (with a zero).

Otherwise, I am Hugo Mougard and currently a Master's degree student
at the [University of Nantes][3], in the natural language processing
field ([résumé][4]).

Besides interesting problems and algorithms, I love free software as a
way to have a philosophically interesting impact on society whilst
still remaining in the computer science domain.

Apart from Computer Science, I enjoy [classical piano][5], [old
movies][6], philosophy, boxing and
strategy games---from [chess][7] to DotA.
