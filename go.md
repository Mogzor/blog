Go is a great strategic game, similar to chess and extremely popular in Korea, China and Japan.
It has had two golden eras in the western world: the anime Hikaru no go and more recently the crowning of AlphaZero as the first AI to reach super-human level.

I list below the go resources I enjoy the most.

## Servers

To play the normal (19x19) game, I use [OGS](https://online-go.com/) and [Tygem](http://www.tygemgo.com/).
OGS is friendlier to use but Tygem has a larger player pool (and **a lot** more strong players).
For 9x9, [GoQuest](http://wars.fm/go9) has a game ready in seconds.

## Tsumego

I use mainly [Tsumego Pro](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TsumegoPro), even though the problems are badly ranked.
From time to time I also use the [collections gathered by tasuki](https://tsumego.tasuki.org/).
They contain only problems, not solutions, which makes them both frustrating at times and very rewarding.
Last but not least, [goproblems.com](http://goproblems.com/) has a huge database of problems that is collaboratively extended and curated.

## Learning

Apart from playing mindfully (which is by far the fastest and most efficient way to improve), the ways to learn I enjoyed the most were:

- getting reviews from stronger players both online and in local clubs
- learning from Inseong Hwang at the [European Yunguseng Dojo](https://eyd.yunguseng.com/)
- reviewing my own games with [Leela Zero](https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/), using [Lizzie](https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/) as an interface

A friend of mine also started [:fr: Art du Go](https://artdugo.fr/), a great website to discover the fundamental concepts of Go if you understand French.
