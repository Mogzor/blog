First and foremost, to discuss the content of this blog or about
anything you'd like, you can [email me][mail].

Otherwise, I am Hugo Mougard and currently a PhD student at the
University of Nantes, in the natural language processing and machine
learning fields---here is my [résumé][resume]. I also enjoy going to
and giving talks for the [Nantes Machine Learning Meetup][nmlm].

Besides interesting problems and algorithms, I love free software as a
way to have a philosophically interesting impact on society whilst
still remaining in the computer science domain.

Apart from Computer Science, I enjoy [classical piano][kissin],
[old movies][million], philosophy and strategy games, especially go
and HearthStone.
