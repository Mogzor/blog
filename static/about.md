First and foremost, to discuss the content of this blog or about
anything you'd like, you can [email me][mail] or talk to me on
[freenode][freenode]---I'm m09 back there (with a zero and a nine).

Otherwise, I am Hugo Mougard and currently a Master's degree student
at the [University of Nantes][atal], in the natural language
processing field---here is my [résumé][resume]. I am also a proud
member (and ex-president) of the [ASCII][ascii] association---the
computer students society of my university and I enjoy going to the
[Nantes Functional Programming Group][nfp].

Besides interesting problems and algorithms, I love free software as a
way to have a philosophically interesting impact on society whilst
still remaining in the computer science domain.

Apart from Computer Science, I enjoy [classical piano][kissin], [old
movies][million], philosophy, boxing and strategy games---from
[chess][chess] to DotA.
