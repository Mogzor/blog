Hi, I'm [m09][github]. I am currently working at [source{d}][src-d] as
a machine learning engineer. I also enjoy going to and giving talks
for the [Nantes Machine Learning Meetup][nmlm] (and co-organize it).

Apart from computer science, I “enjoy” learning about the environmental and societal collapse---the recent field devoted to this transdisciplinary activity is called [collapsology](/collapsology) and I <s>“</s>enjoy<s>”</s> [classical piano][kissin], [old movies][million], [climbing][honnold] and [go][go].

Something to discuss? [Drop me a line](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
